## SCSS

Just like CSS, Scss also supports the @import directive. The @import directive allows you to include the content of one file in another.

The CSS @import directive has a major drawback due to performance issues; it creates an extra HTTP request each time you call it. However, the Scss @import directive includes the file in the CSS; so no extra HTTP call is required at runtime!

## SCSS Ampersand

The & is an extremely useful feature in Sass (and Less). It’s used when nesting. It can be a nice time-saver when you know how to use it, or a bit of a time-waster when you’re struggling and could have written the same code in regular CSS.

"&-" can be quite useful if employing a naming methodology (i.e. BEM) which uses dash and underscore combinated classes rather than combined selectors.
