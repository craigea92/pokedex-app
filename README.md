## SCSS

Just like CSS, Scss also supports the @import directive. The @import directive allows you to include the content of one file in another.

The CSS @import directive has a major drawback due to performance issues; it creates an extra HTTP request each time you call it. However, the Scss @import directive includes the file in the CSS; so no extra HTTP call is required at runtime!
